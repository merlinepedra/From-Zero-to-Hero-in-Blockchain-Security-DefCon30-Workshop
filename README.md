---

Blockchain technology has to be one of the biggest technology innovations of the past few years. The top emerging blockchain development trends are crypto coins, NFT, Defi, and even metaverse. Nowadays, Companies are adopting blockchain technology and moving to the decentralized world. Especially smart contract technologies, which open them to a new cyberattack in a new crypto world. While technology evolves cybercriminals evolve along and we constantly hear about the theft of millions of dollars at security breaches in smart contracts everywhere.

In our workshop, we will teach you what is a Blockchain, what is a smart contract and what security vulnerabilities it possesses. Our workshop is intended for beginner to intermediate level hackers who want to learn new blockchain and crypto hacking techniques based on dApps TOP 10 v2022.

In the workshop, we will teach how to find vulnerabilities in blockchain smart contracts according to the latest methods and techniques. We will demonstrate every vulnerability by giving an example on the blockchain and show everything from both attacker and defender perspectives.
